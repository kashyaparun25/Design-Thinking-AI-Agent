## Overview

**Design Thinking AI** is a collaborative ecosystem where human creativity meets artificial intelligence. Powered by a team of specialized **AI agents**, this application guides users through the entire [design thinking process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking)‚Äîa methodology centered on solving problems by deeply understanding users‚Äô needs. The classic stages‚Äî**Empathize**, **Define**, **Ideate**, **Prototype**, and **Test**‚Äîare augmented with additional steps like **Process Management**, **Decision Documentation**, and **Final Reporting**, all driven by AI.

Each **AI agent** plays a pivotal role:
- The **Empathy Researcher** uncovers user pain points with precision.
- The **Innovation Facilitator** sparks creative breakthroughs.
- The **Reporting Agent** delivers a comprehensive final report.

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), the app provides an intuitive interface that fosters human-AI collaboration, capturing feedback at every stage to refine outcomes iteratively. Whether defining a challenge or testing a prototype, the **AI agents** ensure accuracy, creativity, and continuity throughout.

## Detailed Workflow Explanation

### Challenge Setup üéØ

**Purpose:**  
Users define or generate the design challenge‚Äîspecifying context, constraints, and success criteria‚Äîwhich is stored in `st.session_state.project_input`. This forms the basis for all subsequent tasks.

**Output:**  
A clear, actionable challenge statement that guides the outputs of the AI agents.

### AI Agents and Their Roles ü§ñ

The system is powered by a **Design Thinking Crew** consisting of several specialized AI agents:

- **Empathy Researcher**  
  **Stage:** Empathize  
  **Role:** Gathers deep insights about user behavior and pain points.  
  **Impact:** Establishes the foundational qualitative insights for the process.

- **Problem Definition Specialist**  
  **Stage:** Define  
  **Role:** Synthesizes research data into a clear problem statement and creates user personas.  
  **Impact:** Sharpens focus by clarifying the core problem to address.

- **Innovation Facilitator**  
  **Stage:** Ideate  
  **Role:** Generates creative solutions using techniques like brainstorming and lateral thinking.  
  **Impact:** Expands the range of possibilities with innovative ideas.

- **Prototyping Specialist**  
  **Stage:** Prototype  
  **Role:** Converts ideas into tangible prototype plans, specifying key features and milestones.  
  **Impact:** Bridges abstract ideas to practical, testable models.

- **User Testing Coordinator**  
  **Stage:** Test  
  **Role:** Designs testing protocols and gathers user feedback.  
  **Impact:** Validates the solution and suggests refinements.

- **Design Thinking Process Manager**  
  **Stage:** Process Management  
  **Role:** Oversees the workflow and ensures context is preserved across stages.  
  **Impact:** Maintains continuity throughout the process.

- **Design Process Reporter**  
  **Stage:** Decision Documentation & Final Report  
  **Role:** Documents the complete design journey, compiling insights, outputs, and decisions into a final report.  
  **Impact:** Provides transparency and a historical record of the process.
